# Welcome to UI-KIT

The UI Kit is an atomic component library meant to be used and maintained by multiple teams. The library is currently based off Angular Material 11 and UI Kit specifications supplied by the UI/UX team. It can contain, but is not limited directives (which are used to customize existing Angular Material components to make them look and behave as described in the Axos design system), services, models, and custom components (which can/cannot contain Angular Material components).
