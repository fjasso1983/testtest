  code={dedent`
    <div class="uk2-transparent-scrollbar--medium">
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    </div>
  `}
/>

  You can use mixins to apply scrollbar style in our components, note that using mixins is very useful for handling responsive scrollbar styles.
